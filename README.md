# Bleach-Death-Bringers

Death Bringers is a new Bleach, the anime, inspired game using HTML, CSS, &amp; JS.

## Mechanics

So far the mechanics are built off sprites being animated on the HTML Canvas.

This is done through the requestAnimationFrame method which manipulates the canvas using an image you provide

Currently, sprites must be in a single row so that the sprites can be iterated through frame by frame

This is still being developed so many things may change, but for now many of the animations will be done using this method

It is still unclear if this will be turn based or a hack and slash due to my inexperience with JS game development
